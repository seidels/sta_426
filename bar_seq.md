# Bar-seq

### Summary 

Bar-seq is a method to determine the abundance of genetic barcodes in
a mixture. The technique can be used for functional profiling,
e.g. mutant fitness profiling. T-tests provide a statistical
argument, for when the abundance of a species changed significantly
under experimental conditions.
